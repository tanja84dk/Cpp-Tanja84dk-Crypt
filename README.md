## 1. Introduction

This is mostly a wrapper collections of encodings/ciphers that I use in some of my things to make it easier if I have to change out the actual encoding/cipher that i need

### 1.1 Background

The reason I made it in to a collection instead of separate were I saw myself need it several times so it made it a lot easier to maintain to have it as its own module/project that I then only have to update one place

### 1.2 Working at this moment

## 2. Technical

### 2.1 Required libraries

- CPM - CMake dependency management

### 2.2 Requiring libraries

CMake dependency management is used to download the required libraries for compiling so its not needed for you to have it installed on your system prior compiling

By default its downloading the libraries to the build folder and is storing them within a folder called \_deps
